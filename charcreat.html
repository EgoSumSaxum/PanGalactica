		<p>In Pan Galactica, every party starts with a file. This file can be a folder in a google drive, a sheet with all of the information written on it, or, most commonly, an actual folder. This will contain all of your crew’s character cards, your ship card, and a sheet containing all of your possessions.</p>
    <h3>Character Card</h3>
    <p>Your character card represents the statistics of your character themselves. Character cards in this game are relatively small, as characters themselves are not too remarkable, but the decisions that they  make are. Characters in this game are very dependent upon the decisions and judgement of the players. Additionally, characters themselves do not change too much throughout the game. The main changes have to do with belongings, position within organizations, and the ships that they pilot.</p>
    <h3>Species</h3>
    <p>When you are creating your character, you can choose a species from among the numerous intelligent life forms that exist throughout the galaxy. Different species have different abilities, but they do not affect statistics. For example, you might be a Nat’larin with a tough exoskeleton that protects you from physical harm far more effectively than skin, or an earless Tarnien, who’s pressure sensitive pores offer you 360 degree awareness even in pitch-black or smokey conditions. These species are presented in the species cards.</p>
    <h3>Specialty</h3>
    <p>Your specialty is the most important factor in how your character will be played in pan galactica. This determines whether your character is a brilliant researcher or engineer, a brave pilot, or a skilled communicator. The classes are presented in the class cards.</p>
    <h3>Statistics</h3>
    <p>Statistics are chosen by the player as the last part of character creation. You must allocate a d12 to one stat, a d10 to another, and a d8 to a third. Whenever you make a check with one of the three abilities, you roll the dice that you have allocated to that ability to make the check.</p>
