		<p>Pan Galactica is a table top RPG that is set in the far future of the thirtieth century. In this RPG, your crew will explore the galaxy in the pursuit of information, adventure, recognition, and wealth. As you upgrade your ship and build up your skills, you will face more complex and dangerous challenges.<br> In pan galactica, all of the information for your crew is stored in a folder. This includes character cards, ship cards(or drawings), species cards, and specialty cards. Due to its simple nature, all that is needed to play this game is a few pieces of paper and some dice. Character and ship cards can be printed from this website, and species and specialty cards can be printed or referenced. This website is currently a prototype, and does not contain all content due to the game still being in development.</p>
